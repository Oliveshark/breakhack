Something in the ways of a roguelike
================================

A simple roguelike written in C using SDL2.

Idea
----
Randomly generated maps/rooms. Leveling system, permadeath,
multiple classes. Casual and fun for 10-20 minutes during a break
from regular work/play.

I wanted to practice C and I'm comfortable using SDL2. The assets
are graciously taken from the web. More info in the README in the
assets folder.

Download
--------
This game is available in the [steam store](https://store.steampowered.com/app/931040/BreakHack/) (release Okt 2018).
If you enjoy the game and want a properly installed, signed copy of the game with achievements and
global highscores you are most welcome to purchase it there.
If you feel like getting a free copy you can download and compile from here.

Issues
------
I'd prefer if issues could be handled here on github. Either check the list if your particular problem is reported
otherwise create a new issue. Support questions can be submitted as issues as well, I haven't figured out how I want to
work with support yet since I haven't received any questions.

License
-------
BreakHack is released under two different licenses.

- The source code is released under [GPLv3](https://github.com/oliveshark/breakhack/blob/master/LICENSE.txt)
- The Steam release is released under the [Steam subscriber agreement](https://store.steampowered.com/subscriber_agreement/)

Compile
-------
* [Linux](LINUX_BUILD_INSTRUCTIONS.md)
* [Windows (Visual Studio)](MSVC_BUILD_INSTRUCTIONS.md)

Contribute
----------
Have an idea and able to implement it? Fork and send me a pull request and
I'll check it out. If I like it I will add it. If it's a big thing I'll add 
your name to the credits list (once I add it in game).

If you do contribute something you should be aware that if your PR is merged
into the master code-base your code will eventually make it out with the Steam version
of the game. I don't make any revenue from those sales so don't expect any other compensation
than a "I have code on Steam" feeling. Which is quite nice and also why I decided to release
on Steam.
